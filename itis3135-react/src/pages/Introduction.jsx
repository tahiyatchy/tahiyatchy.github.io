      <p>I am an international student from the smallest sovereign state in the Western hemisphere, St. Kitts and Nevis, where my parents immigrated from Bangladesh. I enjoy watching movies and dissecting them extensively using the literary and visual microscope in my brain. I dabbled in code for the first time when I was about 12 when I modified the HTML code in my Tumblr bio to add a hyperlink.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Personal Background:</strong> I was born and lived in St. Kitts until coming to UNC Charlotte. I've known I'd be going to school for Computer Science since I was about 13, which was also when I decided I would go into machine learning and data science.</li>
        <li><strong>Academic Background:</strong> I am a senior majoring in Computer Science and concentrating in Data Science. I plan on earning my MS in Computer Science via the early entry program.</li>
        <li><strong>Courses I'm taking and why:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>ITIS 3135 - Front-End Web App Development:</strong> fulfills technical elective requirement; a skill I'd like to develop for my own projects</li>
            <li><strong>AMST 3090 - Politics and Conflict in American Horror & Sci-Fi Film:</strong> the perfect intersection of my greatest interests</li>
            <li><strong>FILM 1502 - Introduction to Film & Media:</strong> I enjoy analysing film; self-indulgent course</li>
            <li><strong>ITSC 3688 - Computers and Their Impact on Society:</strong> major requirement; a less technical course to balance out my other computing courses</li>
            <li><strong>ITCS 3153 - Introduction to Artificial Intelligence:</strong> helps me get started on the material I would like to study in my MS program and use in my career</li>
            <li><strong>WRDS 4201 - Composing Across Borders:</strong> retake because the structure and requirements of the course the first time I took it wasn't for me, especially at the time, and I wasn't happy with the grade</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
