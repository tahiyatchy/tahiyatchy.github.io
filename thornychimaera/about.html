        <h2>About Thorny Chimaera</h2>
        <div class="about-content">
            <p>Founded during the rare celestial alignment of 2012, Thorny Chimaera emerged from the vision of its enigmatic proprietor, Morgana Ravenscroft. What began as a small cabinet of curiosities has blossomed into a sanctuary for those seeking objects with unusual histories and mysterious properties.</p>
            
            <p>Our collection is thoughtfully curated, with each item personally selected for its unique energy, historical significance, or aesthetic appeal. We specialize in ritual tools, divination aids, rare books, and unusual artifacts that you won't find in ordinary shops.</p>

            <p>We believe that objects carry energy and history, and we take great care to document the provenance of each item when possible. Whether you're a seasoned practitioner or newly curious about the esoteric arts, our knowledgeable staff is here to guide you without judgment.</p>
            
            <p>Beyond our physical collection, we host monthly workshops on topics ranging from tarot reading to talisman crafting, and we maintain an extensive archive of occult literature available to serious researchers by appointment.</p>
            
            <p>At Thorny Chimaera, we honor all spiritual paths and traditions, providing tools and artifacts from diverse cultural backgrounds while respecting their origins and significance.</p>
