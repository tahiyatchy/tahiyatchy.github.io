    <h2 style="text-align: center; border: 10px dotted red; margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 20px;">This is my SECOND heading but it comes first!</h2>

    <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 28px;">Welcome to my absolutely terrible website that I made without following any best practices whatsoever and I'm just putting random thoughts here because I don't really know what to write but I need to fill up some space with text that doesn't really say anything important at all</p>

    <div style="margin: 10px 200px 10px 5px;">
        <h1 style="font-family: Papyrus; text-decoration: underline;">This is my FIRST heading but it comes second!</h1>
        
        <p style="font-size: 8px;">Here is some tiny text that is very hard to read because it's so small and the contrast is terrible</p>
        
        <p style="font-size: 40px; background-color: #F0F0F0; color: #F5F5F5;">This text has very poor contrast with the background making it difficult to read which is exactly what we want for a bad website</p>
    </div>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;">First item in centered list</li>
            <li style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;">Second item in centered list</li>
            <li style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;">Third item in centered list</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>I love space. Please look at this picture.</h3>

    <p style="font-family: Papyrus; text-decoration: underline;">This paragraph uses papyrus font and has underlined text that isn't a link which is very confusing for users</p>

    <p style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;">This paragraph uses comic sans because why not use the most hated font on the internet</p>

    <p style="font-family: Times;">This paragraph uses times font to complete our terrible font trilogy</p>

    <p style="font-size: 2px;">Here's some microscopic text</p>

    <p style="font-size: 50px;">AND HERE'S SOME GIANT TEXT FOR NO REASON</p>

    <a href="https://www.example.com">This is a link with default colors</a>

    <p>Lots of extra blank lines above this text</p>







    <p>Even more blank lines at the very end of the page</p>
