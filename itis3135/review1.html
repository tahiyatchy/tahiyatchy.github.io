      <h3>Navigating to Jordi's Site</h3>
      <p>
        Jordi does not have a link to their Client Project anywhere on their course site. However, I was able to figure out the link by looking through their GitHub repository and finding the name of the folder. I would strongly suggest adding a link to their course site navigation to avoid this.
      </p>
      <p>
        While I was going through their repository, I noted that there are no spaces in any of the file names. However, in the images folder, "Sitemap.png", "Wireframe.png", and "marco_working.JPG" use capitalization. Otherwise, all other files and folders have suitable lowercase names.
      </p>
      <h3>Design</h3>
      <p>
        Jordi's site on first glance generally has good contrast with consistent layout and design elements in accordance with CRAP principles. One glaring exception is the h1 heading in the header, which is the <strong>same color as the header background</strong> and impossible to see without selecting the text. Other exceptions to this are the validator links in the footer, which are both default blue and purple when visited and in poor contrast with the footer color.
      </p>
      <h3>Structure</h3>
      <p>
        Jordi's pages' body tags include a header, main, and footer. The site title is in the header in an h1 tag. The page name is in main. The footer includes HTML and CSS validator links and validates, but does not include an accessibility checker.
