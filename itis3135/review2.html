      <h3>Navigating to Johnny's Site</h3>
      <p>
        Johnny's course site link leads to their Github.io course page. To access their client project on CLT web, I appended "/itis3135" to their CLT web link and clicked the appropriate button in their primary navigation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Johnny's file names are all lowercase without spaces. Johnny does not use any folders for their client project. The images on Johnny's Github.io client project site load as intended. However, they do not display on the CLT web site, presumably because the image files were not uploaded to the server.
      </p>
      <h3>Design</h3>
      <p>
        Johnny's page scores 77% on a WCAG accessibility checker. This is due to a lack of sufficient contrast between the text color and background color in the navigation bar, the "Reset Canvas" button, and the footer text. Otherwise, Johnny's page has a consistent design, logical alignment, and appropriate spacing. The link in the footer has the default color.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the Home and GBMs pages, Johnny either does not have a heading for the page title or has one that is the same size as the subheadings on the page. This could be addressed to improve visual hierarchy.
      </p>
      <h3>Structure</h3>
      <p>
        Johnny's pages' body tags include a header, main, and footer. The site title is in the header in an h1 tag. There are no validation links in the footer. Instead, Accumulus is included on all pages, which shows two HTML errors in "about.html".
