        In web development, CRAP stands for Contrast, Repetition, Alignment and Proximity. These principles serve as a guide to ensure accessible and user-friendly website design. The following two websites are examples of poor design and good design respectively, according to CRAP principles.

    <h3>Outerbanks Lighthouse Society: A Website with Faults</h3>
    <p>
        The <a href="https://www.outerbankslighthousesociety.org/" title="Outerbanks Lighthouse Society Website">Outerbanks Lighthouse Society</a> seemed to me at first sight to be somewhat garish, but acceptably designed. Using CRAP principles, it is easier to identify the design errors which create this impression.
    </p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Contrast</strong>
                <p>
                    While an attempt has been made to enhance the contrast of the home page description by adding a semi-transparent solid background behind the text, it is still inconvenient to read due to the header background image. The clarity of the white text on the darker container is disrupted by the white clouds in the background image.

                    On the <a href="https://www.outerbankslighthousesociety.org/links.html">Links & Resources</a> page, the section headings almost completely blend in to the background.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Repetition</strong>
                <p>
                    The secondary navigation on the home page lacks a consistent style for the headings. They each have different capitalization and different letter spacing. Only one of them has a link on the text, while the other ones have links in the images (it is not clear these images are links in their context and it would in fact be more intuitive design to attach the links to the text).

                    The two buttons under the description are on the same line and enhance the page's symmetry in their position but have radically different design. The font, text styling, capitalization, color, shape, borders, and supplementary styling are all completely different and not at all visually cohesive.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Alignment</strong>
                <p>
                    The "Page1" text in the common headers moves around the page at random for each hovered navigation link.
                    
                    The first two containers in the secondary navigation on the home page have a "Read More" on the same line, but the third says "Let's have fun!" lower than the other two, disrupting the cohesiveness of these adjacent containers.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Proximity</strong>
                <p>The "Page1" text in the common headers and footers, when none of the navigation links are hovered over, is very close to the navigation links and is in the same font, color, and size, making it difficult to distinguish as not a navigation link.

                The letter spacing of the home page secondary navigation is inconsistent across the adjacent containers even though headings are centered and not justified.</p>

        <h3>Independent Picture House - A Successful Website</h3>
        <p>The <a href="https://independentpicturehouse.org/" title="Independent Picture House">Independent Picture House</a> is a well-designed website. This is how it holds up against CRAP principles.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Contrast</strong>
                <p>
                    Despite the many images on several pages, there is never an issue with legibility when it comes to the text placed on top of them. The text is a large, thick, white sans serif font laid over eother the vignetted corners of the image or placed over images with their exposure lowered.
                    
                    The overall theme is very clean, with high contrast between the text and background. Even so, the site never uses full white (#fff) over full black (#000) or vice versa. It opts instead for slighly more gray shades of both, as is advised in dark display design.

                    The navigation bar stands out clearly from the rest of the page, and the links are stark against it.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Repetition</strong>
                <p>
                    The entire site has a very cohesive theme; it uses the same font from the navigation down, modifying the size and styling based on its visual purpose. The images in each section are the same size and with the same amount of space between them. The sections on each page, while visually distinct from one another with their alternating colors, keep to the theme and palette of the page.

                    On the Now Playing page, which is the landing page, the first body section and the second body section (titled "Coming Soon...") format their containers in ways which are distinct from one anotehr but consistent in their respective sections while both maintaining even spacing between containers.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Alignment</strong>
                <p>
                   The images on the landing page are spaced evenly from one another and the left and right edges of the screen. The image content is consistently justified across the page. The secondary navigation is center-aligned, which creates a cohesion with the primary navigation and maintains the symmetry of the page.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Proximity</strong>
                <p>
                   In each section, everything is spaced consistently. Between sections, there is a consistent amount of greater space working with the more explicit separation of the different background colors to distinguish the end of one and the start of another. The logo gets a little smaller and the header links come a little lower in the sticky header when the user scrolls down, bringing attention away from the header and to the content of the page.
